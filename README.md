Implementing_Exploratory_Data_Analysis on Netflix_dataset in R

I use Netflix Data set and I want to answer the following questions and insights that are important for the audience: 
1- How many films were released from 1945 to 2022? 
2- What categories of films were released from 1945 to 2022? 
3- To which audiences were the films released from 1945 to 2020?
4- Which audience is the most film released for? 
5- What are the audiences of each category of film?? 
6- Which are the ten countries that have released the most films from 1945 to 2022? 
7- Which are the ten films with the most popularity from 1945 to 2022? 
8- Which are the ten actors who have the greatest number of appearances in the films from 1945 to 2022? 
9- Which are the ten directors who have made the greatest number of films from 1945 to 2022? 
10- Which are the ten genres with the most popularity from 1945 to 2022?

I used two data sets called credits and titles. The credits data set has 5 variables and 77213 observations. 
it gives information about the films that are in the “Title” data set from 1945 to 2022. Like: 
the name with the type of character, characters with the type of character, roles (actors and directors) 
with the type of factor, and id with the type of numeric. 
The Titles data set has 17 variables and 5806 observations. it has information about the name of films 
with the type of character, type of movie/show with the type of character, a description of films with the 
type of character, year of release with the type of double, age_ceratificate with the type of character, 
runtime with the type of double, genres with the type of character, production_countries with the type of 
character, seasons with the type of double, imdb_score with the type of double, imdb_votes with the type 
of double, tmdb_score with the type of double and tmdb_popularity with the type of double.
